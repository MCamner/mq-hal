# Verify the GitHub release page agrees with the versions this repo declares.
#
# Two questions. The second is the one that was missing: is the version about
# to be released already published, and was the *previous* declared version
# ever published at all.
#
# v2.3.0 and v2.4.0 were tagged, pushed, and never released, and nothing
# noticed for a month. The only check asked whether the current version
# existed on GitHub — and "no" is the right answer both before a release and
# after a forgotten one, so a skipped publish stayed invisible, permanently,
# from the next version bump onward.
#
# The predecessor comes from CHANGELOG.md rather than from the tag list. Tags
# carry things that are not releases: `archive/…` references kept as evidence,
# and a lightweight `v2.1.0` from before the annotated-tag convention. The
# changelog is where a version is declared to exist, so it is what "previous
# version" should mean.
#
# Network: one or two `gh release view` calls. release-check.sh keeps this
# behind its own --dry-run guard, and --json implies --dry-run, so the
# machine-readable preflight stays network-free.
